# Bicommunal Bizonal Federation

# What is the BBF?

BBF refers to the form of government Cyprus will have in the post-solution era. BBF is the solution model agreed by the two Cypriot communities in 1977 and the only basis for a solution according the UN Security Council Resolutions. As the title says, it has three basic elements, Bicommunality, Bizonality and Federation.

# What are the three elements of BFF?

Bicommunality: This element exists in the current Constitution of the RoC. The Republic of Cyprus is a state built on the idea that the people of Cyprus is consisted by two politically equal communities. The political equality is reflected in both the current Constitution of the RoC and in a BBF solution. More about political equality in a future post.

Federation: In the new state of affairs the United Republic of Cyprus will be a federation(the RoC of Zurich was a unitary state). Around 14% of the states in the world are federations. A federal model provides autonomy to its federated units/states/provinces/cantons while maintaining a Central Federal Government responsible for the more important issues. The federated units of a federation are of equal status. Cyprus will have single international legal personality, meaning Cyprus will have only one voice abroad, and a single sovereignty emanating equally by GCs and TCs(February 2014). That is contrary to the sovereign equality supported by Tatar since the sovereignty of Cyprus is only one, not two, and it is exercised jointly by the two communities, not separately.

Bizonality: The United Republic of Cyprus will be consisted by two zones, the GC federated unit and the TC federated unit. The meaning of Bizonality greatly changed over the years, especially after Cyprus joined the EU. More on bizonality in a future post.

# Why BBF?

In 1977 the GC side accepted BBF in order to get to a solution in what was described as a painful compromise. Ever since it remains the only solution model within the realms of possible.
Any solution plan will need to be approved in separate referendums. The alternatives (1)unitary state (2)two-states will not be accepted by (1)TCs (2)GCs so the only alternative of solution is the status quo that is both unacceptable and dangerous, for both communities.

Did GCs reject BBF in 2004?

No, GCs rejected the solution plan known as the Annan Plan V in 2004.

"President Papadopoulos reaffirmed his commitment for a Bizonal Bicommunal Federation solution saying it would be a mistake for someone to assume that this specific Annan plan is the only one corresponding to this model of solution." (June 2004, a few months after the referendums)
