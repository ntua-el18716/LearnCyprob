A principle of the separation of powers is the cornerstore of democracy.

## Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus

- Executive Structure: The President of the Republic comes from the Greek Cypriot community and the Vice-President comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community
- Head of the State: The President is the Head of the State, the VP is the Vice-Head of the State
- Election: Direct election of the President by Greek Cypriots and the Vice-President by Turkish Cypriots. The two communities vote separately.
- Rotating Presidency: No rotating presidency

## Presidential Council - Annan Plan - The Swiss Model

The "Swiss Model" refers to the system where the executive power is exercised by a Presidential Council. Based on previous negotiations its composition would be 2/3 coming from the Greek Cypriot federated state and 1/3 coming from the Turkish Cypriot federated state.

The Annan Plan included a version of the "Swiss Model".

**Annan Plan:**

- Executive Structure: 4 coming from the GC constituent state, 2 coming from the TC constituent state. Two of its members coming from different constituent states will serve as the President and the Vice-President of the Council
- Head of the State: The Presidential Council is the Head of the State. The President of the Council shall
- Election: The Council shall be elected on a single list by special majority(2/5 of Senators from each constituent state) in the Senate and approved by majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
- Decision Making: Simple majority comprising of at least one vote from a member of each federated state
- Rotating Presidency: 2:1 ratio - The President and the Vice President will rotate every 20 month, starting with a GC President.

Different versions based on the Swiss Model have been proposed over the years. A recent proposal supported the enlargement of the council from 6 members to 9 or even 15(10 from the GC federated state, 5 from the TC) elected directly by the people in each federated state(proportional representation) so that all ideologies are represented in the Council.

- Executive Structure: 10 coming from the GC constituent state, 5 coming from the TC constituent state.
- Head of the State: The Presidential Council is the Head of the State.
- Election: The Council shall be elected directly by the voters of each federated state using proportional representation so that all ideologies are represented in the Council.
- Decision Making: Simple majority comprising of at least one vote from a member of each federated state
- Rotating Presidency: 2:1 ratio - Rotation of the presidency every 6 months between the top 6 candidates coming from the GC federated state and the top 3 candidates coming from the TC federated state.

## President and Vice President elected with a single ticket

Another option proposed mainly by Greek Cypriot politicians is the "USA model". In this model two candidates, one from the GC federated state and one from the TC federated state, run together on a single ticket. The election is conducted on a nationwide basis, with the whole Cyprus being treated as a single constituecy.

- Executive Structure: The President and the Vice-President
- Head of the State: The President is the Head of the State
- Election: Direct election of the President and the Vice-President with the whole of Cyprus being treated as a single constituecy on the principle of one person one vote
- Rotating Presidency: 2:1 ratio

## President & Vice-President - Rotating Presidency with Weighted Cross-Voting

- Executive Structure: President and the Vice-President
- Head of the State: The President is the Head of the State.
- Election: Direct elections from the voters of each federated state with weighted-crossvoting
- Decision Making: Simple majority comprising of at least one vote from a member of each federated state
- Rotating Presidency: 2:1 ratio

This system includes rotating presidency between the President and the Vice-President with a ratio of 2:1(4 years of GC:2 years of TC) in combination with weighted crossvoting.

### How it works?

- The electorate as a whole, GCs and TCs, vote simultaneously for both the President and the VP(cross voting). For the election of the TC member of the Presidency the votes of the Greek Cypriots are weighted so that they form the same percentage as the percentage of the Turkish Cypriot registered voters in the electorate as a whole.

- In simpler words, if the registered voters of the TC federated state are 20% of the total number of voters in the whole of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots will be able to influence the result for the GC member of the Presidency by 20%. The votes of Greek Cypriots for the TC member of the Presidency will be weighted to influence it by the same percentage, 20%.

- The Turkish Cypriot side suggested that this percentage of influence shall not exceed 20%

- The Greek Cypriot side suggested that the system should be combined with a single-ticket

### Pros

- The biggest advantage of this system is that because of the cross-voting, the candidates from both federated states will need to appeal and address the concerns of both communities
- The election of nationalists or of politicians building their rhetoric against the other Community will be extremely difficult
- The request of the TC Community to be able to hold the office of the Head of the State is satisfied
- Neither the President nor the Vice-President will vote in the Council of Ministers. If both jointly disagree with a decision of the CoM on external relations, defence or security they may vote against it.

### Cons

- The issue of rotating presidency in this context rather than within a Presidential Council is more obvious and may lead to people rejecting a solution plan

- Because of the population difference between the two communities, the vote of a Greek Cypriot for the TC member of the Presidency will 'weight' less than the vote of a Turkish Cypriot for the GC memmber. The philosophy of the system is that the two Communities should be able to influence the election of the member of the other federated state the same (otherwise GCs would be able to elect both)

- Though extremely hard, it will be possible for a member of the Presidency to secure enough votes in his own federated state to get elected regardless of the result in the other federated state. That said, such high percentages are extremely rare in functioning democracies. In Cyprus the last President of Cyprus that secured such a high percentage was Archbishop Makarios III while in the Turkish Cypriot Community it was Rauf Denktash(1990).

### Single ticket

Single ticket in the context of weighted cross-voting is completely different than the single ticket with a single constituecy.

The main difference is that two candidates for the Presidency (one from each federated state) run together on a single ticket. The way the results are calculated remains the same so it's possible that members from different tickets are elected. The advantage of the single ticket lies on encouraging candidates from different Communities to cooperate and establish a common mainifesto. If A and B are running together on the same ticket both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots who want to vote for one of them will vote for the common ticket. The main problem with this system is that there are parties in the two Communities that would have trouble finding a member of the other Community to run together on the same ticket. Perhaps such a system could be applied after a few election cycles.
