**_"Cyprus is the common home of the Greek Cypriot community and of the Turkish Cypriot community. Their relationship is not one of majority and minority, but one of two communities in the State of Cyprus."_**

<div align="right" style="italic">
  **_UNSG Report 1990_**
</div>

Ever since the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus
the relationship between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots was based on the
idea that the two Communities are politically equal. While the term is not
explicitly used in the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus it is reflected in
its bi-communal nature and the effective participation of the two Communities in
the State.

Political Equality is a fundemendal element of a United Federal Republic of Cyprus. In 1990 the UNSG Ghali gave the first definition of political equality.

<div>
  "The political equality of the two communities in and the bi-communal nature
  of the federation need to be acknowledged. While political equality does not
  mean equal numerical participation in all federal government branches and
  administration, it should be reflected inter alia in various ways: in the
  requirement that the federal constitution of the State of Cyprus be approved
  or amended with the concurrence of both communities; in the effective
  participation of both communities in all organs and decisions of the federal
  Government; in safeguards to ensure that the federal Government will not be
  empowered to adopt any measures against the interests of one community; and in
  the equality and identical powers and functions of the two federated States."
</div>

## Key-points of Political Equality:

1. political equality doesn't not mean equal numerical representation in all federal institutions

2. the two federated states will have equal status and identical powers

3. any changes to the Consitution will require the approval of both communities

4. the Federal Government won't be able to take measures harming the interests of one of the communities

5. acknowledgement of the effective participation of the two communities in all organs and decisions of the federal Government

During the negotiations there have been different views in two sides on how political equality will be reflected in a United Cyprus. While many convergences have been achieved over the years two outstanding issues remained:

### Divergences:

#### Effective Participation of the two Communities:

While both communities acknowledge the effective participation of the two communities there are different views on what exactly it means.

- **Greek Cypriot Position:** At least one positive vote of a Turkish Cypriot should be required in all the decisions of the Council of Ministers that affect the vital interests of the Turkish Cypriot Community or the Turkish Cypriot federated state.

- **Turkish Cypriot Position:** At least one positive vote should be of a Turkish Cypriot required in all the decisions taken by any institution of the Federal Government where the two communities don't have equal representation.

- **Compromising Position:** At least one positive Turkish Cypriot vote will be required in all the decisions of the Council of Ministers. A positive vote will be required only for a limited number of other federal institutions. \
  _This compromising solution προκύπτει from past interviews of Mavroyannis, Celebis, Akinci, the notes of Crans Montana as well as the Christofias-Talat Convervences._
