# Bizonal Bicommunal Federation

**Bizonal Bicommunal Federation** is the basis for the solution of the Cyprus Problem agreed since 1977. It refers to the system of governance of Cyprus in the post-solution era, one federal country consisting of two regions and administered by the two Cypriot communities.

## Federation

A federation is a political system where multiple regions or entities are united under a central government. Each federation is different but the fundamental concept is that that power is distributed between a central authority and the individual entities within the federation. These entities have different names in various countries. In the USA they are called _states_, in Switzerland _cantons_, in Belgium _regions_, in Canada _provinces_, in UAE _emirates_, in Germany and Austria _bundesl√§nder_. In Cyprus different terms have been used over the years with the most common being _constituent states_ and _federated states_.

Each of the two federated states will operate with its own Constitution, Parliament, Police Force, Government and Judiciary. These state-level institutions will handle internal affairs, ensuring autonomy and decentralized governance within the broader federal structure.

The Federal Government, as the central authority in the federation, will hold key competences including Foreign Policy, Economy management, Citizenship, Defense, EU affairs and Migration oversight.

United Federal Republic of Cyprus will have a single international legal personality, a single sovereignty and a single United Cyprus citizenship. Cyprus will remain a member of the UN and the EU.

## Bicommunality

Bicommunality refers to the political and social structure in Cyprus, where the two communities, the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, are recognized as politically equal.

In a federal Cyprus, the bicommunal nature of the Republic of Cyprus will continue, ensuring the effective participation of both communities in all the institutions of the Federal Republic.

| Federal Institution      | Greek Cypriot federated state | Turkish Cypriot federated state |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| House of Representatives | 75%                           | 25%                             |
| Senate                   | 50%                           | 50%                             |
| EU Parliament            | 4 seats                       | 2 seats                         |
| Council of Ministers     | 7 seats                       | 4 seats                         |

## Bizonality

The Federal Republic of Cyprus will be consisted by two constituent states, the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot. The two federal states will share equal status and will be administered by each community.

Over the years the definition of bi-zonality included guaranteed clear majorities of population and land ownership in each federated state which resulted in limitations on the exercise of the right of free movement.

With the accession of Cyprus to the EU and the application of the EU acquis all Cypriot citizens will enjoy the three basic freedoms which will allow them to abode(live), work, operate a business throughout Cyprus. Any limitations will only apply to the exercise of political rights.
