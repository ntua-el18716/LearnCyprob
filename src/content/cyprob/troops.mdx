# Troops

One of the major aspects of the Cyprus problem is presence of foreign troops on the island. It is estimated that more than 40.000 Turkish soldiers are stationed in the north of Cyprus.

First of all a major dinstiction needs to be made between the presence of troops in accordance to the Treaty of Alliance(950 Greek and 650 Turkish soldiers) and the troops that arrived in the island in 1974.

## Positions of the sides

The Greek Cypriot side considers the full withdrawal of the occupying troops a prequisite for a solution and supports the abolishment of the Treaty of Alliance(while accepting the possibility of the contination of the Treaty of Alliance for a number of years after a solution - sunset clause). Permanent presence of foreign troops is considered unacceptable.

The Turkish Cypriot side considers the withdrawal of Turkish troops a danger to the security of the community and believes that the Turkish and Greek forces should be drawn down to an agreed level. The continuation of the Treaty of Alliance is also supported.

## Annan Plan

The Annan plan provided the gradual withdrawal of the troops to the levels of the Treaty of Alliance over a period of 14 years. The presence of the remaining troops would be reviewed every three years with the objective the full withdrawal. It also provided for the dissolution of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot forces including reserve units with the full demilitarization of Cyprus being the objective.

Greek and Turkish contingents shall be permitted to be stationed under the Treaty of Alliance in the Greek Cypriot State and the Turkish Cypriot State respectively as follows:

- each contingent not to exceed 6,000 all ranks, until 2011;
- each contingent not to exceed 3,000 all ranks thereafter until 2018 or the European Union accession of Turkey, whichever is sooner; and
- the Greek contingent not to exceed 950 all ranks and the Turkish contingent not to exceed 650 all ranks thereafter, subject to three-yearly review with the objective of total withdrawal;

## Gutteres Framework

_"Fast significant reduction of troops to the level of the Treaty of Alliance (ToA), which implies 650 troops, with the detailed modalities for purpose and mandate, SOFA, verification mechanism and timetable - without prejudice to an agreement on sunset close vs review;"_

At the final dinner in Crans Montana the SG acknowledged that "zero-troops zero-guarantees" was a red line for Turkey whereas a long-lasting Turkish military presence remained a red line for the Greek Cypriots. He concluded that this discussion needed to be held at a higher level (i.e. involving the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey).

## Opinion

It is important to address the worries of both communities in Cyprus. For Cyprus to be truly independent foreign troops need to go. The withdrawal of the troops need to happen within agreed timetables shorter than those of the Annan Plan. The Treaty of Alliance could continue to be in effect
