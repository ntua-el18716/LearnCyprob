### GOVERNANCE AND POWER-SHARING

#### SECTION 1: CONVERGENCES

- **Executive Term**: The presidency shall not be voted out of office by a motion of no confidence. A six-year term.
- **Council of Ministers**: There will be a Council of Ministers/Executive Council with an agreed number/ratio of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
- **Council of Ministers appointment**: The Presidency shall appoint conjointly the members of the Council of Ministers.

The remaining Greek Cypriot Ministers will be appointed by the Greek Cypriot member of the presidency and the remaining Turkish Cypriot ministers by the Turkish Cypriot member of the presidency.
- **Council of Ministers decision-making**: The Council of Ministers shall strive to reach all decisions by consensus. If this is not possible, decisions shall be taken by a simple majority of members present and voting, [comprising at least one vote from each community/provided this comprises at least two members from each community]. At least two votes from each side will be required for decision-making in the Council of Ministers.

\*Convergence on the direct election of the presidency does not necessarily mean that direct elections, or a presidential executive, are the only options the two sides might converge on.

  2. In this case, the parliamentary procedure is automatically suspended and the motion referred to the Supreme Court which, within thirty days, gives its reasoned binding opinion on the motion and decides whether it is justified or not.
  3. If the Supreme Court decides that the motion is justified then the relevant draft law shall be deleted (removed) from the agenda of the House of Representatives and the same draft cannot be resubmitted to the House of Representatives.

Constituent States shall be consulted on federal decisions on external relations that affect their competences. Federal decisions on external relations within the spheres of competence of the Constituent States shall be made in agreement with the Constituent States with the additional safeguard that determined efforts shall be made through the JCER for the resolution of any relevant differences.

If the Federal Executive decides positively, it shall inform the other High Contracting Parties accordingly.
- If both federated units object to the conclusion of a treaty, the Federal Government shall refrain from signing such a treaty. If both Constituent States object to the conclusion of a treaty on matters falling within their competences, then the Federal government shall not conclude such a treaty.

- Commercial matters (Footnote: Subject to finalization of the agreement on federal competences/Commercial matters include economic investment and financial assistance) and cultural matters (Footnote: Cultural matters include inter alia language, religion, customs (including dress, cuisine), arts (including theatre, dance, music, and literature), education (including matters of primary, secondary and tertiary education, vocational institutes, co-operation in research), and sports):
  - No prior consent of the Federal Government will be required for agreements on commercial matters and cultural matters. The Constituent States shall have the right to conclude international treaties with other states, international organizations, and sub-entities on these matters. However, the Constituent States shall inform the federal government at every stage. The federal council of ministers shall be able to suspend the conclusion of such treaties if certain conditions are met (as described in the Turkish Cypriot proposal dated 12 January 2011).
  - On certain matters falling into the competences of the Constituent States (such as agriculture, fisheries, and forestry) the Constituent States will have the right to conclude international treaties with other states and international organizations subject to prior consent of the federal government. Moreover, Constituent States shall use the channel of the federal ministry on external relations for contacts at a political level with foreign governments. However, they may have direct contacts with Constituent States, sub-entities, or subordinate authorities of other states in the conclusion of such treaties.
  - On other matters falling into their competences, the Constituent States shall have the right to conclude treaties with other states and international organizations by informing the federal ministry of external relations at every stage.

  - No prior consent of the Federal Government will be required for agreements with sub-entities or subordinate authorities of States.
  - The agreements referred to above (in the three paragraphs above) can be concluded unless:
