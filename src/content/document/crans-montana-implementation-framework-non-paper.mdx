Implementation by the parties of the following elements of the agreement, based on their respective responsibilities:

1. Constitutional aspects of settlement
2. Territorial adjustment
3. Policing provisions
4. Withdrawal of foreign troops, demobilization of domestic forces
5. Implementation of the property settlement
6. EU acquis compliance (monitoring by EU)

### LEVEL 1: ground-level operational monitoring, including of troop withdrawal and demobilization

Performed by the UN mission; reports to the UN Security Council every three months on all aspects of the agreement.

(Other actors may also play a role â€“ e.g., EU for acquis compliance related issues, etc.)

### LEVEL 2: Committee of the Parties (COP)

**Composition**: 2 Representatives from the Federal Government (1 GC, 1 TC), 1 representative from each of the constituent states, 1 representative from Turkey, 1 representative from Greece, 1 representative from the UK, 1 representative from the UN acting as chair.

**Role**:

- Non-executive body, but with responsibility for:
- Assessing overall implementation by reviewing draft reports prepared by the UN mission
- Providing input over content of reports, where relevant, but with no editorial role (chance to explain etc.)
- Addressing any issues in implementation through consultation, problem-solving.

### LEVEL 3 (OPTIONAL): group of eminent persons

Eminent and trusted Cypriot and/or international personalities

**Role**: Provide advice, support, recommendations in relation to implementation; receive input from implementing parties present on the Committee of the Parties (COP); advising the UN Secretary-General and/or the implementing parties on progress made in implementation.

### LEVEL 4: Impartial certification of implementation by the UN Secretary-General

Based on reports prepared by the UN mission, the UN Secretary-General pronounces himself or herself on whether or not implementation of the settlement is on track. He/she could also receive inputs directly from the implementing parties.

### LEVEL 5: UN Security Council

As an additional measure, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus could be invited to attend sessions of the Security Council when the implementation reports are tabled and considered.
