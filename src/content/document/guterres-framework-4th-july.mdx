**EBE opened the meeting by recalling that this group transforms to a broader group on all issues. He asked that the discussions not be repeated but rather to see how to reduce differences on different points.**

ON asked for clarification of a common understanding of the mandate.

**EBE informed the sides that he clarified with the SG and the Leaders the following understanding (everything "subject to"):**  
[Exact wording recorded in the notes from the 10am meeting, same day]

1. **new security regime**: the end of unilateral right of intervention and of the Treaty of Guarantee (ToG), but with appropriate implementation and verification instruments, including elements outside of Cyprus;
2. **fast significant reduction of troops** to the level of the Treaty of Alliance (ToA), which implies 650 troops, with the detailed modalities for purpose and mandate, SOFA, verification mechanism and timetable - without prejudice to an agreement on sunset close vs review;

3. **effective participation**: 2:1 ratio and one positive vote under possibly two different approaches.

4. **territorial adjustment**: The city of Morphou, as initially known (Note: referring to its return to the Greek Cypriots), with an appropriate resettlement mechanism.

5. **equivalent treatment**: What "equitable" means within the framework of permanent residence (Note: referring to the treatment of Greek and Turkish nationals): with tourists, students, seasonal/seconded workers excluded from this category.

6. **two property regimes**:
   - "Subject to" where the system will give to the dispossessed owners (owners with loss of use).
   - "Not subject to" where the system will give to the current users, but in any case will constitute the rule by 100%. Beyond the above, the property regime should be simple. (Espen Barth Eide continues speaking).

Following the morning meeting with the leaders (Note: Where the correct framework was clarified as mentioned above), the parties agreed to work on everything simultaneously. The working group on the New Security Regime and troops, chaired by ES, started working in parallel.
