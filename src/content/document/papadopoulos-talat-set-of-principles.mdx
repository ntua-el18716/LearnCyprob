## Set of Principles

1. Commitment to the unification of Cyprus based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions.

2. Recognition of the fact that the status quo is unacceptable and that its prolongation would have negative consequences for the Turkish and Greek Cypriots.

3. Commitment to the proposition that a comprehensive settlement is both desirable and possible, and should not be further delayed.

4. Agreement to begin a process immediately, involving bi-communal discussion of issues that affect the day-to-day life of the people and concurrently those that concern substantive issues, both of which will contribute to a comprehensive settlement.

5. Commitment to ensure that the "right atmosphere" prevails for this process to be successful. In that connection, confidence-building measures are essential, both in terms of improving the atmosphere and improving the life of all Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Also in that connection, an end must be put to the so-called "blame game".
