### Key points raised:

### Follow-up action:

- None.

### Summary of the Discussion:

1. The Secretary-General stated that Turkey had been more open in the discussions than others. In his view, this meant there needed to be more openings from the other sides. There had been a proposal from Turkey to maintain the guarantees for a transitional period. At the same time, it was clear that there was a stark difference between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot views on an implementation mechanism. Mr. Anastasiades had been clear in stating that he did not want any participation of Turkey in this regard. Also, there had been little progress on the internal aspects of the talks since his last visit. Practically speaking, nothing had been achieved, except once more outlining points of disagreement.

2. SASG Eide noted that the rotating presidency and one favourable vote in decision-making had been conceded by the Greek Cypriots. Mr. Anastasiades had also indicated that he could accommodate Mr. Akıncı and would not necessarily insist on a single ticket for the elections to the presidency.

3. The Secretary-General stated that outstanding issues included the issue of territory and whose map would be the basis in this regard; property, with different philosophies on how to implement two different regimes; and the rights of Turkish nationals. On none of them had there been any movement. He now intended to ask all sides what sort of concessions they would be ready to make. The aim was to obtain a non-proposal with a possible synthesis on which an agreement could be reached by the prime ministers. However, this would be difficult, also because Turkey had indicated that they were not willing to further prolong the conference.

4. Ms. Mogherini stated that all arguments had been exchanged and that the participants were going around in circles. She had met both Cypriot sides and Greece and Turkey. Her sense was that there was some common ground that could be further aggregated. A package approach could work if there was a balance between the two sides. She had mentioned to Mr. Anastasiades that if he wanted to see a positive development on security **[*]** and guarantees, he needed to show flexibility on intercommunal issues. Mr. Anastasiades had responded that he would be willing to do so, but he needed to be facilitated on issues of guarantees and troops. He would be ready to move away from insisting on a single ticket for the presidency and be more flexible on other issues. However, it was important for him that his map would be the basis for discussions on the territorial issue.

5. Ms. Mogherini stated that the EU would facilitate any agreement reached by the parties, except for the right of intervention which could have more repercussions, for example in relation to Russia and the Russian minorities living in the Baltic states. She had made this clear to Mr. Çavuşoğlu and Mr. Akıncı.

6. The Secretary-General stated that Turkey was considering transitional measures in this regard. Ms. Mogherini stated that Mr. Çavuşoğlu was quite vague when she discussed this issue with him. However, she emphasized that the issue of the right of intervention was excluded. Her concern was that there was not much time left. Nevertheless, she felt that there was no sense of urgency among the participants. Turkey and the Greek Cypriots were concerned for different reasons. For Turkey, the prolongation of the negotiations was not acceptable. Neither was the deadlock acceptable for Greece and the Greek Cypriots. Perhaps it was possible to lock in some agreement and leave the details for later. They needed to achieve a positive outcome, for example with an agreement on a framework.

7. The Secretary-General stated that Turkey was very clear in its statement that it would not accept further delay. He was thinking of proposing a package himself, but there was risk in that. In any case, Mr. Anastasiades would not be ready to make concessions on table 2 unless there was movement on table 1.

8. The Secretary-General's Advisor Mr. Eide said that success could only come in a package. If guarantees were taken off the table, other issues would follow. However, Turkey would never move unless the Turkish Cypriots saw a successful outcome in the intercommunal negotiations. There had to be a package through which these issues could be resolved simultaneously.

9. The Secretary-General stated that the room for maneuver was limited, but he hoped they could produce some results.

10. Ms. Mogherini said she conveyed the message that the EU was ready to facilitate any agreement. She had also told Mr. Çavuşoğlu that changes in primary law were not necessary. There would be no basis for successfully challenging the solution in court. Moreover, any changes to primary law would have to be ratified by member states, and there was a high risk that such an effort would end there. However, Mr. Çavuşoğlu insisted on his view that changes to primary law were needed. Her impression was that this was a position used for bargaining purposes. She asked if there was anything else she could do. She had spoken with Vice President Pence before he called the leaders. She would pass on the same messages, for example, a call for leadership.
