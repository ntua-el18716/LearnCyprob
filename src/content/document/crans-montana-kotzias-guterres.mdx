### Key points raised:

### Follow-up action:

None.

### Summary of the Discussion:

1. The Secretary-General stated that he saw a good chance to reach an agreement that would abolish the guarantees from day one of the settlement. However, the situation was more difficult regarding the complete withdrawal of the troops. Neither issue was closed in his view. In his view, achieving more flexibility there depended on what the Turkish Cypriots could secure in the bi-communal negotiations.

2. Mr. Kotzias stated that he had understood that the Greek Cypriots had conceded on all issues except for the issues of equivalent treatment.

3. The Secretary-General stated there were still widely different positions on most of the issues. His assumption was that the Turkish Cypriots were ready to make further concessions as regards territory, but not to the extent expected by the Greek Cypriots. With respect to the rotating presidency, a single ticket was not acceptable to the Turkish Cypriots. The property issue was similarly difficult. Mr. Kotzias stated that Greece was not involved in any of these questions.

4. The Secretary-General stated that some clarity had been achieved with respect to the issue of equivalent treatment. The outstanding question was whether there should be a quota for Turkish nationals who were seeking permanent residence. For naturalization, the sides had agreed on a ratio of 4:1. It was his feeling that the Greek Cypriots needed to be more generous when it came to permanent residents.

5. Mr. Kotzias stated that in the last 47 years, more than 40,000 Greeks had moved to Cyprus, while more than 67,000 Greek Cypriots had moved to Greece.

6. The Secretary-General stated that his strategy was to persuade Mr. Anastasiades to be more forthcoming on this question. There needed to be movement on table 2 in order to obtain results on table 1. Admittedly, Turkey was not ready to accept immediately that all troops had to leave. However, they had not closed the door to that possibility. It would therefore be good to reach a package agreement with essentially only one or two questions left open. These could be decided by the prime minister at a meeting in New York the following week.

7. Mr. Kotzias stated that if the Treaty of Guarantee was abolished, the Greek Prime Minister would be open to such a meeting.

8. The Secretary-General stated that in addition, a system of monitoring was needed. This should be under the responsibility of the United Nations and with involvement by the three guarantors. He was not sure whether it was acceptable to Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots to have no explicit role for them, even under the terms of the gentlemenâ€™s agreement outlined by Mr. Kotzias earlier.

9. Mr. Kotzias stated that there was a need for Turkey to expressly state that it would withdraw many of its troops. The question was the number of troops that would stay behind. If they went beyond numbers foreseen in the Treaty of Alliance, there would be a problem. In any case, he would now brief the Greek Prime Minister.

10. The Secretary-General stated that any quid pro quo depended on Mr. Anastasiades. For Turkey to contemplate giving up the guarantees would be a big step.

11. Mr. Kotzias stated that providing equal participation to 20 percent of the Cypriot population had already been a big step for the Greek Cypriot side.
