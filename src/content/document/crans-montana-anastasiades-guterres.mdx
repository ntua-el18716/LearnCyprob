**Key points raised:**

- The Secretary-General shared in confidence with Mr. Anastasiades Turkey’s proposal to abolish the Treaty of Guarantees and to end the unilateral rights of intervention.

**Follow-up action:**

- None.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. The Secretary-General informed that Turkey had presented to him some ideas confidentially. Based on the confidential paper from Turkey, the Secretary-General was of the view that there was an opening on the issue of security and guarantees. Turkey indicated its intention to abolish the 1960 Treaty of Guarantees and to end the unilateral rights of intervention. The Treaty of Guarantees could be replaced by an implementation and monitoring mechanism. Although Turkey was not in a position today to accept the complete withdrawal of all its troops from Cyprus, it might happen at a later date.

2. Mr. Anastasiades demanded clarity about Turkey's proposal whether indeed the Treaty of Guarantees would end.

3. The Secretary-General confirmed that the Treaty of Guarantees would end, and that the issue of the troops could be resolved at a later date. An implementation and monitoring mechanism would follow.

4. Mr. Anastasiades enquired whether Turkey would play a role in the implementation and monitoring mechanism.

5. The Secretary-General said that Turkey's role had not been discussed, but he was of the view that various entities and actors could play a role in supervising the implementation process.

6. Mr. Anastasiades underlined that he could not accept Turkish troops being part of any monitoring mechanism. He said that although the end of the Trety of Guarantees might be viewed as a positive thing, to replace it with a monitoring system with Turkey playing a role in the implementation process was something that he simply could not accept. He went on saying that to have Turkish troops continue stationed in Cyprus would be unacceptable to him.

7. The Secretary-General confirmed once again that Turkey would be willing to have an immediate and significant reduction of its troops. A review of the troops would not be tooday but it could happen later.

8. Mr. Anastasiades said that he did not believe that Turkey had a real intention to abolish the Treaty of Guarantees. Turkey wanted to infiltrate its role into the implementation and monitoring mechanism, and hide its real intention by abolishing the Treaty of Guarantees.

9. The Secretary-General stressed that the Treaty of Guarantees was flawed and now that Turkey was finally willing to give it up, it would be a good thing for the 37 percent of the island to be united with the rest. He said that what he could do was to try to bring the parties closer to each other’s positions. The end of the Treaty of Guarantees presented a real opening for negotiations.

10. Mr. Anastasiades responded that Turkey wanted to have a military base and station its troops in Cyprus forever. It was Espen Eide’s idea. It was Nuland’s idea for Turkey to have a base in the north, he asserted. “We are an EU member state. What kind of independence would we have if we still have a military base on the island?”, he asked.

11. The Secretary-General reiterated that he wanted to end the Treaty of Guarantees as the first step, then it would be possible to talk about removing the troops. “Zero troops, zero guarantees” would be a non-starter. He added that the proposal tabled by the Greek Cypriot delegation was a good one because it contained a useful element of “Coordination and Consultation Committee”. He suggested broadening the scope of the proposal to build more consensus. He concluded that if it did not work, it would be difficult to move forward.

12. Mr. Anastasiades was concerned about what should be the announced concering the outcome of the bilateral meeting. He said that he would never accept a half agreement, an agreement that dealt only with guarantees and unilateral rights of intervention but nothing about the troops. He demanded the complete withdrawal of troops on day one. He repeated that he could not accept such an agreement and he could not present it to his people.
